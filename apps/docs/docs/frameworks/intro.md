# Agent Frameworks Overview

Welcome to the Agent Frameworks documentation section. This section provides comprehensive documentation and analysis of various AI agent frameworks, their capabilities, and how they can be integrated with Web3 technologies.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They combine language models with reasoning capabilities and tool usage to accomplish complex tasks.

## Framework Categories

We analyze frameworks across several categories:

- **LLM-Based Frameworks**: Frameworks built around Large Language Models
- **Orchestration Tools**: Tools for managing and coordinating multiple agents
- **Development Platforms**: Platforms that simplify agent development
- **Specialized Frameworks**: Frameworks designed for specific use cases

## Featured Frameworks

- **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models (documentation coming soon)
- **LangGraph**: Graph-based agent orchestration framework (documentation coming soon)
- **AutoGen**: Multi-agent conversation framework (documentation coming soon)
- **CrewAI**: Framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents (documentation coming soon)

## Web3 Integration

Many of these frameworks can be enhanced with Web3 capabilities:

- Blockchain interactions
- Smart contract integration
- Decentralized storage
- Crypto wallet connectivity
- NFT and token operations
