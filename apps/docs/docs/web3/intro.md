# Web3 Integration Guide

This section covers how to integrate AI agent frameworks with Web3 technologies, including blockchain interactions, smart contracts, and decentralized systems.

## Overview

Web3 integration enables AI agents to interact with blockchain networks, execute smart contracts, manage crypto assets, and leverage decentralized infrastructure.

## Integration Patterns

### Blockchain Interactions

Agents can interact with blockchain networks to:

- Read on-chain data
- Execute transactions
- Monitor events
- Query contract state

### Smart Contract Integration

Integrate agents with smart contracts for:

- Automated contract execution
- Event monitoring and response
- State management
- DeFi protocol interactions

### Decentralized Storage

Leverage decentralized storage solutions:

- IPFS for file storage
- Arweave for permanent storage
- Decentralized databases

### Wallet Integration

Connect agents with crypto wallets:

- Transaction signing
- Balance checking
- Multi-signature support

## Supported Networks

- Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains
- Solana
- Cosmos
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- And more...

## Examples

See our [Examples](/docs/examples/intro) section for practical implementations.
